# KNIME-Python-Integration
This repository contains KNIME workflow for document matching using cosine similarity. This also illustrates use of Python code in KNIME. KNIME has python extension where we can code in python in KNIME nodes that are provided by the python extension.

Document similarity is mainly used in scenarios where we need to cluster the documents having similar topic/content together or to detect plagiarism. Cosine similarity technique is one of the ways to achieve this.
In this implementaton, the cosine similarity code is written in python and this code is integrated with KNIME using the KNIME Python extension. Scikit learn library of python has been used for computing the cosine similarity.
